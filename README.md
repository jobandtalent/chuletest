## Chuletest

Chuletest is just a collection about testing practices in the Jobandtalent frontend guild. 
This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, install all the dependencies:

```bash
yarn
```

Then, run the development server:

```bash
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start adding or editing content by modifying markdown documents under `mdx/posts`.

This project is made and maintained by the amazing humans of the [Jobandtalent](https://jobandtalent.com) frontend guild. And that's all. **Happy testing**.

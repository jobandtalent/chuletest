An important part of a modern frontend application is the client routing. We use `react-router` to handle it, and it's great, but it adds some complexity when we want to tests components that depends on a `<Router>` component. But harder it's not impossible, in fact, with a minimal setup, testing client routing is pretty easy.

Let's jumping into code. Let's assume we have this dummy application code, for simplicty, let's put all code in one "file", but remember kids, don't this at home:

```
import React from "react";
import {
  BrowserRouter as Router,
  useParams,
  Switch,
  Route,
  Link,
  Redirect
} from "react-router-dom";

const Home = () => {
  return (
    <div data-testid="home">
      <ul>
        <li>
          <Link to="/23">Detail 23</Link>
        </li>
        <li>
          <Link to="/24">Detail 24</Link>
        </li>
        <li>
          <Link to="/25">Detail 25</Link>
        </li>
        <li>
          <Link to="/wadus">Detail totally wrong</Link>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </div>
  );
};

export const Detail = () => {
  const { node } = useParams();
  console.log(node);

  const allowedIds = ["23", "24", "25"];

  if (!allowedIds.includes(node)) {
    return <Redirect to="/not-found" />;
  }

  return (
    <div data-testid="detail">
      <div>Detail ID: {node}</div>
      <Link to="/">Back</Link>
    </div>
  );
};

export const Container = () => {
  return (
    <Switch>
      <Route exact path="/">
        <Home />
      </Route>
      <Route exact path="/not-found">
        <div>404</div>
      </Route>
      <Route path="/:node">
        <Detail />
      </Route>
    </Switch>
  );
};

export default function App() {
  return (
    <div data-testid="App" className="App">
      <Router>
        <Container />
      </Router>
    </div>
  );
}
```

Awesome, let's start adding some tests:

```
import { render, screen } from '@testing-library/react';
import App, {Container} from './App';

describe('App', () => {
  test('renders properly', () => {
    render(<App />);
    expect(screen.getByTestId('App')).toBeInTheDocument();
  });
})

describe('Container', () => {
  test('renders properly', () => {
    render(<Container />);
  });
})
```

If you run your test task in the console, you will see that the first test passes but we get an error for the second test:

```
Error: Invariant failed: You should not use <Switch> outside a <Router>
```

It makes sense, the error is pretty clear, we should add a Router before testing our `Container` component in isolation. So let's create an utility to use it in these kind of scenarios that lets us to define the current route rendered:

```
import React from "react";
import { createMemoryHistory } from "history";
import { Router } from "react-router-dom";
import { render } from "@testing-library/react";

export const renderWithRouter = (
  ui,
  {
    route = "/",
    history = createMemoryHistory({ initialEntries: [route] })
  } = {}
) => ({
  ...render(<Router history={history}>{ui}</Router>),
  history
});
```

This utility is just basically a HOC, that wraps the UI passed as prop inside a memory Router. The HOC also allows an initial route prop that it's very handy to render the initial state. The HOC returns the `history` and all the selectors returned initially by `@testing-library`.

If now we update our tests to use the `renderWithRouter` utility to render the `Container` component, we see that now all it's green. Even we have no asserts in the second test, there is no error either, so we can see it's working properly.

Now we can test more insteresting things like redirections, current route and so on:

```
import { render, screen, waitFor } from '@testing-library/react';
import {renderWithRouter} from './utils'
import App, {Container} from './App';

describe('App', () => {
  test('renders properly', () => {
    render(<App />);
    expect(screen.getByTestId('App')).toBeInTheDocument();
  });
})

describe('Container', () => {
  test('renders home properly', () => {
    const {history} = renderWithRouter(<Container />);

    expect(screen.getByTestId('Home')).toBeInTheDocument();
    expect(history.location.pathname).toBe('/');
  });

  test('renders detail properly', () => {
    const {history} = renderWithRouter(<Container />, {route: '/23'});

    expect(screen.getByTestId('Detail')).toBeInTheDocument();
    expect(history.location.pathname).toBe('/23');
  });

  test('renders 404 properly', async () => {
    const {history} = renderWithRouter(<Container />, {route: '/44'});

    expect(screen.queryByTestId('Detail')).not.toBeInTheDocument();

    await waitFor(() => {
      expect(history.location.pathname).toBe('/not-found');
    })
  });
})
```

We should do the same for the `Detail` components to test it in isolation, but it should be pretty much the same.

Sometimes we can augment the HOC to include the redux store as well. In this case we will include the `Provider` and the redux store as well:

```
import React from 'react';
import { createStore, applyMiddleware, compose, combineReducers } from 'redux';
import thunk from 'redux-thunk';
import { Provider } from 'react-redux';
import { createMemoryHistory } from 'history';
import { Router } from 'react-router-dom';
import { render } from '@testing-library/react';

export const renderWithRouter = (reducers, initialState = {}) => {
  return (
    ui,
    { route = '/', history = createMemoryHistory({ initialEntries: [route] }), reducers, initialState={} } = {}
  ) => {
    const { csrfToken = 'wadus', ...rest } = initialState;
  const store = createStore(
    combineReducers({ ...reducers, csrfToken: () => csrfToken }),
    rest,
    compose(applyMiddleware(thunk))
  );

    return {
    ...render(
      <Provider store={store}>
        <Router history={history}>{ui}</Router>
      </Provider>
    ),
    history
  }
  });
};
```

And that's all, happy testing.
